## The PyPI Terms of Service

Effective date: February 25, 2025

### Definitions

**Short version**:
*We use these basic terms throughout the agreement,
and they have specific meanings.
You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms.
There's not going to be a test on it,
but it's still useful information.*

* An "Account" represents your legal relationship with PSF.
A "Personal Account" represents
an individual User’s authorization to log in to
and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on PyPI.
"Organizations" are shared workspaces
that may be associated with a single entity
or with one or more Users
where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once.
A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
* The "Agreement" refers, collectively, to
all the terms, conditions, notices
contained or referenced in this document
(the "Terms of Service" or the "Terms")
and all other operating rules,
policies (including the [PyPI Privacy Notice](Privacy-Notice.md))
and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.
Most of our site policies are available at [policies.python.org](https://policies.python.org).
* "Content" refers to
content featured or displayed through the Website,
including without limitation:
code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics,
software, applications, packages, designs, features,
and other materials that are available on the Website
or otherwise available through the Service.
"Content" also includes Services.
"User-Generated Content" is Content, written or otherwise,
created or uploaded by our Users.
"Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
* "PSF," "We," and "Us" refer to the Python Software Foundation,
as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors,
licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
* The "Service" refers to
the applications, software, products, and services provided by PSF.
* "The User," "You," and "Your" refer to
the individual person, company, or organization that has visited
or is using the Website or Service;
that accesses or uses any part of the Account;
or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions.
A User must be at least 13 years of age.
* The "Website" refers to
the PyPI website located at pypi.org,
and all content, services, and products provided by PSF
at or through the Website.
It also refers to python.org, pyfound.org, pythonhosted.org,
and other subdomains of PSF-owned domains.
Occasionally, websites owned by PSF may
provide different or additional terms of service.
If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement,
the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

### Account Terms

**Short version**:
*Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls;
a human must create your Account;
you must be 13 or over;
you must provide a valid email address;
and you may not have more than one free Account.
You alone are responsible for your Account
and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account.
You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

#### 1. Account Controls

##### a. Users.
Subject to these Terms,
you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account
and the Content within it.

##### b. Organizations.
The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has
ultimate administrative control over that Organization
and the Content within it.
Within the Service,
an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects.
An Organization may have multiple owners,
but there must be
at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization.
If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms,
we consider you responsible for
the actions that are performed on
or through that Organization.

#### 2. Required Information

You must provide a valid email address and a username in order to
complete the signup process.
Any other information requested,
such as your real name, is optional,
unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity
(in which case we need more information about the legal entity)
or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case
additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

#### 3. Account Requirements

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on the PyPI Service.

You must be a human to create an Account.
Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
Machine accounts may be permitted if they pre-date features designed
to fulfill similar duties such as
Upload tokens (2019) and Organization accounts (2025).

* A machine account is an Account
set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account,
provides a valid email address,
and is responsible for its actions.
A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks.
Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account,
but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for
the machine's actions.
You may maintain no more than
one free machine account
in addition to your free Personal Account.
* You must be age 13 or older.
PSF does not target our Service to children under 13,
and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service.
If we learn of any User under the age of 13,
we will terminate that User’s Account immediately.
If you are a resident of a country outside the United States,
your country’s minimum age may be older;
in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person
— i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.
A paid Organization may only provide access to
as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use PyPI in violation of
export control or sanctions laws of the United States
or any other applicable jurisdiction.
You may not use PyPI if
you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN)
or a person subject to similar blocking
or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency.
PSF may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to
access certain PSF services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations.

#### 4. Account Security

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.
We offer tools such as two-factor authentication
to help you maintain your Account's security,
but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity
that occurs under your Account
(even when content is posted by others who have Accounts
under your Organization Account
or Accounts which can upload to Projects you own).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password.
The PSF cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage
from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify PSF if you become aware of any unauthorized use of,
or access to, our Service through your Account,
including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

#### 5. Additional Terms

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of PyPI.
For example, you may be a member of an organization on PyPI
with its own terms or license agreements,
or you may download an application that integrates with PyPI.
Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you,
other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

### Acceptable Use

**Short version**:
*PyPI hosts a wide variety of packages from all over the world,
and depends upon users to act in good faith.
While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section,
which include some restrictions on content you can post,
conduct on the service,
and other limitations.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws,
including copyright or trademark laws,
export control or sanctions laws,
or other laws in your jurisdiction.
You are responsible for making sure that
your use of the Service is in compliance with laws
and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances
violate our [Acceptable Use Policy](Acceptable-Use-Policy.md).

### User-Generated Content

**Short version**:
*You own content you create,
but you allow us certain rights to it,
so that we can display and share the content you post.
You still have control over your content,
and responsibility for it,
and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service.
We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

#### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service.
You are solely responsible for the content of,
and for any harm resulting from,
any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to
or otherwise make available via the Service,
regardless of the form of that Content.
We are not responsible for
any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

By uploading Your Content to PyPI, you agree and affirmatively acknowledge the
following:

* Your Content uploaded to PyPI is provided on a non-confidential basis,
    and is not a trade secret.
* You do not know of any applicable unlicensed patent or trademark rights that
    would be infringed by Your uploaded Content.
* You represent and warrant that You have complied with all government
    regulations concerning the transfer or export of any Content You upload to
    PyPI. In particular, if You are subject to United States law, You represent
    and warrant that You have obtained any required governmental authorization
    for the export of the Content You upload. You further affirm that any
    Content You provide is not intended for use by a government end-user
    engaged in the manufacture or distribution of items or services controlled
    on the Wassenaar Munitions List as defined in part 772 of the United States
    Export Administration Regulations, or by any other embargoed user.

#### 2. PSF May Remove Content

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that,
in our sole discretion, violates any laws or PSF terms or policies.

#### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content.
If you're posting anything you did not create yourself
or do not own the rights to,
you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post;
that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post;
and that you will fully comply with
any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content,
we need you to grant us — and other PyPI Users — certain legal permissions,
provide in subections 4 — 6 below.
These license grants apply to Your Content.
If you upload Content that already comes with a license
granting PSF the permissions we need to run our Service,
no additional license is required.
You understand that you will not receive
any payment for any of the rights granted in subsections 4 — 6 below.
The licenses you grant to us will end when
you remove Your Content from our servers.

#### 4. License Grant to Us

We need the legal right to do things like
host Your Content, publish it, and share it.

If you upload Content covered by a royalty-free license
included with such Content,
giving the PSF the right to copy and redistribute
such Content unmodified on PyPI as you have uploaded it,
with no further action required by the PSF (an "Included License"),
you represent and warrant that the uploaded Content
meets all the requirements necessary for free redistribution by the PSF,
users of the Service,
and any mirroring facility,
public or private,
under the Included License.

If you upload Content other than under an Included License,
then you grant the PSF,
its legal successors and assigns,
and all other users of the Service an
irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive license to
reproduce, distribute, transmit, display, perform,
and publish the Content, including in digital form.

This license does not grant PSF the right to sell Your Content.
It also does not grant PSF the right to otherwise
distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service,
except that as part of the right to archive Your Content,
PSF may permit third parties to mirror Your Content.

#### 5. Contributions Under Other Licenses

Whenever you add Content with a specified license,
you license that Content under the same terms,
and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms.
If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms,
such as a contributor license agreement,
that agreement will supersede.

> "Isn't this just how it works already?"

Yep.
This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community;
it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound".
We're just making it explicit.

#### 6. Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you
upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service,
including the rights of integrity and attribution.
However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us,
to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in subsection 4 above,
but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law,
you grant PSF the rights we need to use Your Content
without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content
as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### Private Servers

Some parties may run PyPI-compatible servers that
interoperate with PyPI and PyPI client software.
These third-party servers are not operated by PSF
and are governed by the terms (if any) established by their operators.

### Copyright Policy

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright,
please contact us in accordance with our
[Copyright Policy](https://policies.python.org/python.org/Copyright-Policy/).

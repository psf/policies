# PyPI Privacy Notice

Last updated **{{git_revision_date_localized}}**

This privacy notice describes what personal information the Python Software Foundation (“PSF”)
collects from user of the Python Package Index ("PyPI"),
when and how we share that information,
and why.
This notice is an addendum to the [PSF Privacy Notice](../PSF-Privacy-Notice.md),
which also applies to users of PyPI.

## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

PSF may collect the following information from users of PyPI:

-   Email addresses
-   Display names
-   IP addresses

We use analytics.python.org to aggregate traffic analytics. No personal information is collected. We self-host [Plausible Community Edition](https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting) to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected. Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more.

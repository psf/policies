# Privacy and Data Policy

Last updated **{{git_revision_date_localized}}**

Summary: The Python Software Foundation ("PSF") only collects the information necessary to register you for PyCon US and to provide you access to the PyCon US content and services. Registrant contact information is NOT shared with third parties without your explicit opt-in consent.

If you submit a talk, tutorial, or other content, then your name will be publicly associated with your personal content for purposes of giving you credit for your contribution to the conference and to maintain historical records.

You may opt in to getting email messages about the PyCon US conference, and you may opt-in to sharing basic contact information with sponsors of PyCon US. Choosing not to opt in will in no way detract from your ability to attend or engage with PyCon US.

After PyCon US is over and we have fully discharged all of our responsibilities, we will delete any personal information that is not required to preserve publicly-available educational materials or to maintain legal records.

### 7\. WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH?

The PSF may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist the PSF in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are contractually required to protect personal information disclosed by the PSF and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share your information with service providers, contractors and sub-contractors to help us provide the website, products, events, and services. For example, we may use a service provider to process payment information or provide analytics. When we use service providers, we provide limited access to your information so that such service provider can perform the tasks on our behalf.

The PSF also shares basic contact information (badge name, nickname provided at signup, email address, and country provided during registration) with sponsors if you have explicitly consented to having your contact information shared with those sponsors by permitting them to scan your PyCon US badge. You may also choose to share additional information with specific sponsors via the PyCon US dashboard.

The PSF reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party, if the PSF has reason to believe that disclosing personal information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other website users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Additionally, the PSF may disclose personal information in response to a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, or when we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, subpoena, warrant or other court order requires or authorizes us to do so, or it is required to respond to an emergency situation.

If you choose not to provide the PSF with your personal information, you may still visit some of the PSF website; however, you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services.

### 8\. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ACROSS BORDERS

The PSF is a United States organization, headquartered in the United States. While we are not a global company, we may allow your personal information to be shared with third-party service providers based both within the United States and in other countries. This may entail a transfer of your personal information from a location within the European Economic Area to outside the European Economic Area, or from outside the European Economic Area to a location with the Economic European Area.

When we provide your personal information overseas, we do so in connection with providing information or services or as required or authorized under law. It is possible the overseas entities, which we share your information with, may not be subject to foreign laws that provide the same level of protection of information with, may not be subject to foreign laws that provide the same level of protection of information as your country of residence or employment, or may not be subject to any privacy obligations. Overseas entities may be required or compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as an overseas authority. Where we transfer information outside of the European Economic Areas, we will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information remains protected and secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws. For example, we will implement EU standard contractual clauses (as contemplated by Article 46(2) of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation) between the PSF related entities that share and process personal data. Where our third-party service providers process personal data outside the European Economic Area in the course of providing services to us, our written agreement with them will include appropriate measures, usually standard contractual clauses. For more information about the measures in place, please contact us (see section below "Contacting the PSF with Questions, Concerns, or Complaints").

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use reasonable and appropriate procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

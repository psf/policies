# PSF Privacy Notice

Last updated **{{git_revision_date_localized}}**

Thanks for entrusting the Python Software Foundation (“PSF”) with your personal data.
This Privacy Notice explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your data,
including any personal data we collect and process in order to provide access to our website
and the various services we provide (collectively, the “services”).
For information about the personal data we collect and process when you use a particular PSF service,
please see the privacy notice for that service.

In this Privacy Notice, “personal information” means information which either directly identifies you
(like your name, email address, or billing information)
or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you
(like an account identification number or IP address).

## 1. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT?

For the purpose of data protection laws,
PSF is the data controller in respect to the personal information that we collect and use in providing the services.
As the data controller, we control, manage, and dictate the purpose for which your personal information is used
and how we use your personal information for our business activity.

## 2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

The types of personal information that the PSF may collect include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Information that you provide to us directly
* Information automatically provided by your interaction with our services
* Information that you provide to our third-party service providers and that they provide to us
* Information that we infer from other information you provide

More details about the personal information we collect can be found in the policies for specific PSF services.

If you provide personal information to us regarding or related to a third party,
then you confirm that you have the consent of the third party to share such personal information
and that you have made the information in this Privacy Policy available to the relevant third party.

## 3. USE OF THIRD PARTY SERVICES

PSF uses some third party service providers to assist with providing our services to you.
For more information about the specific service providers we use,
please consult the policy for the specific PSF service you are using.

## 4. SENSITIVE OR SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION

### SENSITIVE INFORMATION

Some countries consider some personal information particularly sensitive or special.
This may include ethnicity, nationality, gender, and other demographic information.
PSF only collects this data when voluntarily given by the individual, and never requires it.
PSF may use this information to create aggregated reports only;
we do not share any person’s sensitive information with third parties except service providers,
subject to confidentiality requirements.

### WEBSITE USAGE INFORMATION

We collect information when you provide it to us,
such as when you email us information,
connect with us on social media,
use the “contact us” feature,
use the subscription feature located on our website,
or when you engage in any other communication,
recorded or otherwise communicated.

PSF collects certain information automatically when you use the services,
such as the IP addresses and domain names of visitors, browser type, history of pages viewed,
and other usage information about your use of the website.
We collect this information for site administration purposes, such as to analyze this data for trends and statistics.
We may share statistical or aggregated non-personal information about our users with
advertisers, business partners, sponsors, or other third parties.
This data is used to customize our website content and advertising to deliver a better experience to our users.
Please see the section below on cookies for information.

### COOKIES

As you use the PSF website and services (and the sites of third party providers contracted to provide services),
those sites may place cookies on your computer.
The cookies we use are strictly functional cookies and have no marketing purpose.
For any third party provider, please see that provider’s cookie policy.

### PRESENTER OR AUTHOR INFORMATION

If you choose to author a written resource,
including a mailing list post,
or apply to speak at a PSF event (whether live and recorded for further broadcasting),
you may be required to provide minimal biographical information to associate with your presentation or materials.
You agree that this information will remain publicly available for purposes of proper attribution of your work
and maintenance of the historical record.

## 5. HOW DO WE OBTAIN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

As noted above, we collect information from you in the course of your use of the PSF website, products, and services.
For example, we collect information from you when you subscribe to our mailing list.
We collect information from you when you contact or communicate with us
(including through the website, by email, or otherwise).
We collect your personal information while monitoring the PSF website, products, and services.
We gather information about you when you provide it to us, or interact with us directly,
for instance engaging with staff or registering for an event.
We may also in certain cases collect or receive information about you from other sources,
such as third party companies.

## 6. HOW DO WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT?

PSF collects personal information for the following principal purposes:

* To provide the services to you
* To enroll you for mailing lists and other communications (opt-in only)
* To register you for events, tutorials, and other services
* To provide you with information about Python, PSF, and our events and services
* To communicate with you and to respond to your questions, inquiries, or concerns
* To administer and improve the PSF website, events, tutorials, and other services
* To process your payment for the PSF services and events
* To prevent and detect fraud
* To protect and enforce our legal rights

We do this for our legitimate business purposes, and under certain circumstances,
to perform a contract between you and us.
We may request your consent in circumstances where a legal justification
over and above legitimate interests is required by applicable law.

## 7. WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH?

PSF may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist PSF in providing services to you
or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above.
These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose
other than to provide this assistance and are contractually required to protect personal information disclosed by PSF
and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy. 

For example, we share your information with service providers, contractors and sub-contractors to help us provide
the website, products, events, and services.
To illustrate, we may use a service provider to process payment information or provide analytics.
When we use a service provider, we provide limited access to your information
so that the service provider can perform the tasks on our behalf.

PSF reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party,
if PSF has reason to believe that disclosing personal information is necessary to
identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to
or interference with our rights or property, other website users,
or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.
Additionally, PSF may disclose personal information in response to
a subpoena, warrant, or other court order,
or when we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, subpoena, warrant
or other court order requires or authorizes us to do so, or it is required to respond to an emergency situation.

If you choose not to provide PSF with your personal information, you may still visit some of the PSF website;
however, you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services.

## 8. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ACROSS BORDERS

PSF is a United States organization, headquartered in the United States.
While we are not a global company, we may allow your personal information to be shared with
third-party service providers based both within the United States and in other countries.
This may entail a transfer of your personal information from a location within the European Economic Area
to outside the European Economic Area, or from outside the European Economic Area
to a location within the European Economic Area.

When we provide your personal information overseas,
we do so in connection with providing information or services or as required or authorized under law.
It is possible the overseas entities, which we share your information with,
may not be subject to foreign laws that provide the same level of protection of information
as your country of residence or employment,
or may not be subject to any privacy obligations.
Overseas entities may be required or compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party,
such as an overseas authority.
Where we transfer information outside of the European Economic Area,
we will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information
remains protected and secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
For example, we will implement EU standard contractual clauses
(as contemplated by Article 46(2) of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation)
between PSF related entities that share and process personal data.
Where our third-party service providers process personal data outside the European Economic Area
in the course of providing services to us, our written agreement with them will include appropriate measures,
usually standard contractual clauses.
For more information about the measures in place, please contact us
(see section below “Contacting PSF with Questions, Concerns, or Complaints”).

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information,
we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website
and any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your personal information,
we will use reasonable and appropriate procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

## 9. YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING REMOVING, CORRECTING OR UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION

If you change your mind on how PSF discloses or uses your information, or wish to access,
correct or update personal information (such as your address), we will endeavor to correct,
update or remove the personal data that you give us.
Information that you have explicitly made available for unrestricted public access,
such as having your name associated with a talk that you provide or contribution to a project,
may not be able to be deleted.

Citizens of certain states (including California and Virginia)
and citizens of countries in the European Union and European Economic Area may have further rights,
including:

* Right of Access to your Personal Information
* Right to Rectify your Personal Information
* Right to Erasure of your Personal Information
* Right to Restrict the use of your Personal Information
* Right to Data Portability
* Right to Object to the Personal use of your Information
* Right to Withdraw Consent
* Right to Complain to the Relevant Data Protection Authority

If these rights apply to you and you wish to exercise those rights, please contact us using the details below.

## 10. HOW LONG WILL WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We will keep your personal information for no longer than is necessary
for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.

## 11. HOW DO WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it.
We implement physical, business and technical security measures.
Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach,
we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it,
so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for.
Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it
unless we are required by law to keep it longer.

## 12. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY NOTICES

We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online.
If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through PSF’s usual channels for
such announcements such as blog posts and forums,
or via email if you provided an email address to register for the service.
Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes
constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.

## 13. CONTACTING PSF WITH QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, OR COMPLAINTS

If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about this Privacy Policy,
please contact legal@python.org.
You are entitled to make an anonymous complaint or inquiry
in relation to this Privacy Notice or your privacy rights;
however, we may require you to identify yourself if required by law or
it is impracticable for us to deal with your matter otherwise.

We will acknowledge receipt of any complaint
and will strive to provide you with a written response within 30 days of receipt of your complaint.
There may be instances where this is not possible due to
the circumstances under which the complaint was made,
the content of the complaint, and the scope of the complaint.
If this is the case, we will respond to your complaint in a reasonable and practical time.

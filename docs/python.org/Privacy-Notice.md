# Python.org Privacy Notice

Last updated **{{git_revision_date_localized}}**

This privacy notice describes what personal information the Python Software Foundation (“PSF”)
collects from <python.org> users,
when and how we share that information,
and why.
This notice is an addendum to the [PSF Privacy Notice](../PSF-Privacy-Notice.md),
which also applies to <python.org> users.

## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

PSF may collect the following information from <python.org> users:

-   Full name
-   Email addresses
-   Company, firm, organization, agency, or other entity information
-   Biography
-   Any other information relating to you (or other individuals) which you may provide to us

We use analytics.python.org to aggregate traffic analytics. No personal information is collected. We self-host [Plausible Community Edition](https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting) to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected. Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more.

## 2. USE OF THIRD PARTY SERVICES

The PSF uses some third party services to assist with operating online services supporting [python.org](https://www.python.org). Specifically, we use:

-   Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host the PyCon US website. We store your registration information on AWS servers. Their use of this information is subject to the [Data Processing Addendum](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-gdpr-data-processing-addendum/) between AWS and PSF and the AWS Privacy Notice (https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/).

-   Fastly to host the <python.org> website and services. Your information transits their servers. Their use of this information is subject to the [Data Processing Terms](https://www.fastly.com/data-processing) between Fastly and PSF and the Fastly [Privacy Policy](https://www.fastly.com/privacy/).

-   Sentry to aggregate error information from the <python.org> website and services. Some personal information may be stored on their servers. Their use of this information is subject to the [Data Processing Addendum](https://sentry.io/legal/dpa/) between Sentry and PSF and the Sentry [Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

## 3. HOW DO WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We use the information you provide in the following ways, in addition to the uses described in the PSF Privacy Notice:

-   To provide the <python.org> website to you
-   To enroll you for Python Software Foundation related mailings (opt-in only)
-   To provide you with information about Python, the Python Software Foundation, and events related to the Python Software Foundation
-   To communicate with you and to respond to your questions, inquiries, or concerns

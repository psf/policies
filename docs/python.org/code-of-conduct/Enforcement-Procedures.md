# Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct Working Group Enforcement Procedures

This document summarizes the procedures the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group uses to enforce the Code of Conduct.

## Summary of processes

When the work group receives a report of a possible Code of Conduct violation, it will:

 0. Acknowledge the receipt of the report.
 1. Log the report
 2. Evaluate conflicts of interest.
 3. Discuss the report in the next work group meeting (members with a conflict of interest are excluded from this discussion and any notes).
 4. Evaluate the reported incident.
 5. If warranted, follow up for further information.
 6. If warranted, vote on action or proposal to be taken.
 7. If warranted, reach out to the moderation/organising body with a recommendation.
 8. Follow up with the reported person.
 9. Decide further responses.
 10. Follow up with the reporter.

## Acknowledge the report

Reporters should receive an emailed acknowledgement of the receipt of their report within one week.

## Log the report

Reports will be logged in a document only visible to Conduct Work group members. Evaluation, follow-ups, and actions will be added until the report is marked as complete.

## Conflict of interest policy

Examples of conflicts of interest include:

 * The reporter or reported person is your manager
 * You have a romantic or platonic relationship with either the reporter or the reported person. It's fine to participate if they are an acquaintance.
 * The reporter or reported person is your metamour. (This is a term used in the poly community; the short definition is [here](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Metamour), and a longer description is [here](https://solopoly.net/2012/09/29/whats-a-metamour-on-my-terms/)).
 * The reporter or reported person is your family member
 * The reporter or reported person is your direct client
 * The reporter or reported person is someone you work closely with. This could be someone on your team or someone who works on the same project as you.
 * The reporter or reported person is a maintainer who regularly reviews your contributions

Committee members do not need to state why they have a conflict of interest; they only need to acknowledge that one exists. Other work group members should not ask why the person has a conflict of interest.

Anyone with a conflict of interest must remove themselves from the discussion of the incident and recuse themselves from voting on a response to the report.

## Evaluating a report

### Jurisdiction

 * *Is this a Code of Conduct violation?* Is this behavior on our list of inappropriate behavior? Is it borderline inappropriate behavior? Does it violate our community norms?
 * *Did this occur in a space that is within our Code of Conduct's scope?* If the incident occurred outside the community, but a community member's mental health or physical safety may be negatively impacted if no action is taken, the incident may be in scope. Private conversations in community spaces are also in scope.

### Impact

 * *Did this incident occur in a private conversation or in a public space?* Incidents that all community members can see will have more negative impact.
 * *Does this behavior negatively impact a marginalized group in our community?* Is the reporter a person from a marginalized group in our community? How is the reporter being negatively impacted by the reported person's behavior? Are members of the marginalized group likely to disengage with the community if no action was taken on this report?
 * *Does this incident involve a community leader?* Community members often look up to community leaders to set the standard of acceptable behavior.

### Risk

 * *Does this incident include sexual harassment?*
 * *Does this pose a safety risk?* Does the behavior put a person's physical safety at risk? Will this incident severely negatively impact someone's mental health?
 * *Is there a risk of this behavior being repeated?* Does the reported person understand why their behavior was inappropriate? Is there an established pattern of behavior from past reports?

Reports which involve higher risk or higher impact may face more severe consequences than reports which involve lower risk or lower impact.

## Propose consequences

What follows are examples of possible consequences of an incident report. This consequences list is not inclusive, and the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary, where applicable.

Possible private responses to an incident include:

 * Nothing, if the behavior was determined to not be a Code of Conduct violation
 * A verbal or emailed warning
 * A final warning
 * Temporarily removing the reported person from the online community
 * Permanently removing the reported person from the online community
 * Publishing an account of the incident

## Work group decision making and voting

Refer to the charter for the current decision-making process: https://wiki.python.org/psf/ConductWG/Charter

## Administrators/moderators approval

Once the work group has approved the behavioral modification plans and consequences, they will communicate the recommended response to the administrators/moderators of the online community. The work group should not state who reported this incident. They should attempt to anonymize any identifying information from the report (unless explicit permission has been given to share this).

Administrators/moderators are required to respond back with whether they accept the recommended response to the report. If they disagree with the recommended response, they should provide a detailed response or additional context as to why they disagree. Administrators/moderators are encouraged to respond within a week.

In cases where the administrators/moderators disagree on the suggested resolution for a report, the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group may choose to notify the Python Software Foundation board.

## Follow up with the reported person

The Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group will draft a response to the reported person and then vote on sending it. The email should contain:

 * A description of the person's behavior in neutral language
 * The negative impact of that behavior
 * Any consequences of their behavior

The work group should not state who reported this incident. They should attempt to anonymize any identifying information from the report. The reported person should be discouraged from contacting the reporter to discuss the report. If they wish to apologize to the reporter, the work group can accept the apology on behalf of the reporter.

## Decide further responses

If the reported person provides additional context, the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group may need to re-evaluate the report and consequences.

## Follow up with the reporter

A person who makes a report should receive a follow-up email stating what action was taken in response to the report. If the work group decided no response was needed, they should provide an email explaining why it was not a Code of Conduct violation. Reports that are not made in good faith (such as "reverse sexism" or "reverse racism") may receive no response.

If deliberation or follow-up with the reported person takes longer than expected, the work group should send a status email to the reporter within a month after the meeting when this report was discussed.

## Documentation and Privacy Policies

In all cases, documents and notes should only be available to committee members who do not have a conflict of interest for the report.

### Committee shared email address

The Conduct Workgroup share one email address. Where possible, this alias is used for all communication.

### Committee online discussion

A Code of Conduct committee may have an online, real-time discussion forum, such as Slack, Zulip, or IRC.

Committee members should not use bots or IRC bouncers to log the group discussions. All documentation of discussions and decisions should be put in online, shared documentation.

#### Report Documentation

Report documents should include:

 * A summary of a verbal report, or the text of an emailed report. Use neutral, non-judgmental words to describe the behavior. Where possible, separate out the behavior of the reported person and the impact on the reporter.
 * A summary of committee discussions, including whether the report is in scope
 * Proposed consequences for the reported behavior
 * A summary of verbal discussions, or the text of email discussions with community moderators, administrators, registration, or other event organizers about the proposed consequences and behavioral modification plan
 * A summary of verbal discussions, or the text of email discussions with the reported person
 * The text that was sent to follow up with the reporter

All discussion summaries should include dates that they took place.


#### Privacy Concerns

There are some common privacy pitfalls to online tools like Google Docs. Make sure to always share the document with committee members who don't have a conflict of interest, rather than turning link sharing on. This prevents people outside of the committee from accessing the documents.

Another common issue is that when a folder is shared with the whole committee, even if a person doesn't have edit or view access to an individual report, they can still see the document's title. This can give information away, such as the person who made the report. Some communities use initials in the report title instead. That can still reveal information, and it makes it hard to talk about report status in public spaces (such as an event). The committee may want to assign a code name to each report, and reference that name in the report title and status spreadsheet. You can use an [online random phrase generator](http://watchout4snakes.com/wo4snakes/Random/RandomPhrase) to create the code name.


## Changes to Code of Conduct

When discussing a change to the Python community Code of Conduct or enforcement policies, the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group will follow this decision-making process:

* **Vote.** Proposed changes to the Code of Conduct will be decided by a two-thirds majority of all voting members of the Code of Conduct work group. Work group members are listed in the [work group charter](https://wiki.python.org/psf/ConductWG/Charter).
* **Board Vote.** For significant changes, i.e. a change in budget,  the Code of Conduct work group shall provide the PSF board with a draft of the changes. The PSF board will vote on the changes at a board meeting.

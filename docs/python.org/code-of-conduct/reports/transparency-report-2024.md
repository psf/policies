# Code of Conduct WG transparency report 2024

The Code of Conduct Working Groups received 20 reports and met 17 times in 2024. This transparency report is a brief account
of how those reports were handled.

The working group conducts business in several ways. It has online meetings, typically scheduled twice a month. It also discusses
issues in a Slack channel, but most cases are handled in the meetings.

The group conducted 27 votes, of which 26 reached quorum. These votes, some held asynchronously, covered a range of topics,
including admitting a new member, responding to various cases, addressing communication matters, updating community guidelines,
and taking actions such as refining the Code of Conduct (CoC) guidelines and providing CoC training.

The 20 reports received by the working group represented 16 distinct issues, because four issues received two reports each.
11 of these 16 reports received active follow up. The working group advised the relevant teams in six cases and four cases
were handled directly by local representatives.

A few cases that did not receive a clear follow up include some cases where no action was deemed necessary. We have improved
our record keeping practices since then, which should ensure better follow up, tracking, and reporting in the future.

Finally, this section provides a brief summary of the kinds of cases that were handled:
- 5 cases involved microaggressions or aggressive language in Discourse.
  - 3 cases were handled directly by event or online space representatives.
  - The working group recommended that the moderators issue a warning in one case.
- 4 cases related to Discourse communication concerning PSF-Vote discussions.
  - The working group made recommendations for enforcement action in two cases.
  - One case was formally logged. In one case, no action was taken.
- 4 cases addressed communication and wording issues on GitHub:
  - In one case, the working group advised moderators to ask the reported individual to communicate more respectfully and thoughtfully.
- 2 cases involved incidents at PSF-sponsored events:
  - 1 case was handled by an event representative.
- 1 case was found not to constitute a Code of Conduct violation.

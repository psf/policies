**NOTE:** The easiest and fastest way to sign a Contributor Agreement with the
Python Software Foundation is to do it while you are submitting your first
change to a [Python-owned repository on GitHub](https://github.com/python/).
That's the recommended way as it is fully automated. The Contributor
Agreement page you're looking at now is mainly intended for signing
Contributor Agreements on behalf of organizations.
The Contributor Agreement form hosted here is manually reviewed
which takes time to process.

## Contributor Agreements

### Procedures

The PSF is now asking all past and future contributors
to sign a [Contributor Agreement](https://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/).

With these forms, contributors formally license their contribution
to the PSF, under an open source license (the "Initial License").
Currently, we accept contributions under the following initial
licenses:

- [Academic Free License v. 3.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0)
- [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php)

This agreement solves, for the PSF, the major issue of relicensing
in open source software: Formally, most licenses at most allow for
relicensing the software on the same terms as the original license.
With the license form, PSF receives the permission to relicense the
software under a different (open source) license than the initial
license - and indeed we distribute Python under the Python license,
not under one of the initial licenses.

At the same time, contributors remain copyright holders of their 
contributions - they are not asked to assign the copyright to the
PSF. They only formally confirm the terms under which they made
their contribution available to the PSF.

The choice of initial license originates from the advice of our
lawyer: the initial licenses should be open source, they should
be clear and explicit in what they permit, and they should not
only include a copyright grant (in particular to reproduce and
prepare derivative works), but also a license grant to all relevant
patents that the contributor holds. As most contributors do not
hold any patents (at least none relevant for the contribution),
the patent grant is likely irrelevant for most contributors.

For more information on licensing and the PSF contribution process,
please see the
[PSF Licensing FAQ](http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq).

## Submission instructions

We accept contributor agreements through
[an online form](https://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/).

You can also submit the agreement by postal mail, fax,
or by email. Please print a copy of the form, fill out your
name, address, and initial license, sign it, and either send via postal
mail to

> Python Software Foundation  
> c/o Secretary  
> 9450 SW Gemini Dr.  
> ECM# 90772  
> Beaverton, OR 97008  
> USA

or send it by fax to +1 858 712 8966

or scan or take a photo of the signed form and email it to
[contributors@python.org](mailto:contributors@python.org).

As the form is designed for future contributions, we ask
past contributors to state that their past contributions are
also covered under the form; we have one such form for past
contributions to [Python](https://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form-python/)
and one form for [Jython](https://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form-jython/).

The **Title** field needs to be filled out only if you are
acting for a legal entity (e.g. president of some company),
i.e. you are filling out the form for the entity, not for yourself.
If you do, fill in the position that you are holding within
that organization.

In order to give Python developers ready access to the list
of forms received, we will publish the names (but not the
addresses) of all contributors in the Python source code repository.

If you have any questions, please mail us
[contributors@python.org](mailto:contributors@python.org).
